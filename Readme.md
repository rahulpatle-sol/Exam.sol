# 🎓 ExamSol: On-Chain Exam Certification System

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Traditional exam systems are opaque, centralized, and vulnerable to manipulation. Students have no verifiable proof of passing, and institutions struggle to audit results. Certificates can be forged, and results are hard to trust.

## 🚀 Use Case

ExamSol is a Solana smart contract that records exam metadata, accepts student scores, and mints a token (or NFT) for students who pass. This token acts as a verifiable, on-chain certificate of achievement.

## 👤 Agile User Story

> As a student,  
> I want to submit my exam score on-chain,  
> So that I can receive a verifiable token if I pass,  
> And prove my achievement to employers or institutions.
